-- Arduino

In order to get the Arduino running, you can download the Arduino IDE, plug in the Arduino with a micro-usb, set the correct board (might require installation of packages) and port, and upload the BLEAdvertiser.ino sketch, which will cause it to advertise as soon as it's powered, at an interval of 20 ms.
